## Motivation
<br>

While living in Denver, Colorado, I have not had a short supply of coffee shops to visit. However, there have been numerous times that I forget about a particular coffee shop in the mountains that I loved or did not like, and this is why the idea for the Coffee Shop tracking app came about. I wanted to create an app that allowed people to track coffee shops and rate them. With this app, users can view their own and other user check-ins to see which coffee shops they should visit or avoid.
